Anyway, somehow I decided to make a place where I could let out the thoughts I couldn’t keep in my head and share them with whoever happens to be here.</p><p>I realized that some of the things I’ve been thinking might actually be worth sharing—not because they’re groundbreaking or anything, but because they’ve helped me. And maybe they might help someone else too. Plus, I tend to think too much, to the point where I forget some of my own thoughts. So this will also help me remember them.</p><p>Whenever something crosses my mind that feels worth writing and sharing, I’ll try to post it here.</p><p>I guess this is just me trying to make sense of my thoughts — and maybe, in the process, someone out there might relate. If not, that’s cool too. At least my brain gets some air. If any of my thoughts spark something, or you just wanna talk about an idea — hit me up! I like hearing how other people think too.</p><p>As for the language, I’ll mostly write in English. Mainly because it feels less cringe when I’m trying to make a point or spill some emotions. Or maybe that’s just me. But I enjoy writing in English, even though it’s not perfect. Tapi juga tidak menutup kemungkinan untuk saya menulis dalam Bahasa Indonesia.</p><p><em>Until my next overthought idea… see you.</em></p>"
